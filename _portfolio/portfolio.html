Food2U is a prototype app designed to connect individuals and businesses with surplus food to local shelters and those in need. Similar to DoorDash, it facilitates the quick and efficient delivery of unwanted food, reducing waste while providing essential support to vulnerable communities. Users can easily donate excess food, track deliveries, and help foster a culture of sharing and sustainability.
