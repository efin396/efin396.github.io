Hi, I'm Elanor! I am a senior Computer Science Student @ Georgia Tech with a passion for software development and machine learning, I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow in these fields. Through my coursework and personal projects, I have gained experience in programming languages such as Java, Python, Javascript and C as well as machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. At Tech, I have taken courses in artificial intelligence, data structures, algorithms, and machine learning, which have provided me with a strong foundation in these areas. I am particularly interested in the intersection of software development and machine learning and have completed several projects that leverage machine learning to help solve real-world problems.
